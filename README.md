# Challenge description:

1. Dashboards are displays we build at New Visions to help each other and our schools make sense of school data. Create a principal and guidance-counselor facing dashboard from the provided dataset that assists in identifying students who are chronically absent (missing X% or more of school days) for targeted interventions by guidance counselors (e.g. parent conferences, SMS messages sent, phone calls home, etc).
Specifically, build a dashboard that:
2. ● Displays a list of students who are chronically absent, including the data points from the data set you feel would be useful and relevant to view alongside each student.
3. ● Allows the principal or guidance counselor to adjust the threshold for what it means to be chronically absent. Upon modifying the threshold, the list of students should change. 



Submit the following
a. In concise, bullet point format, outline the technologies used and the architectural
choices made to build the dashboard. b. Include a link to or a file attachment of the source code for your project. c. Include instructions on how to run your project locally or a link to a hosted
version.
